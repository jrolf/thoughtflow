The Zen of Thoughtflow

First principles first.
Complexity is the enemy.
Obvious is better than abstract.
Transparency is trust.
Backward compatibility is sacred.
Flexibility over rigidity—provide defaults, allow infinity.
Pack light, travel far.
Clarity over cleverness.
Modularity beats monolith—every builder loves legos.
Accommodate beginners and experts alike.
Make a vehicle, not a destination.
Good documentation accelerates everything.
Don't try to please everyone—greatness comes from focus.
Python is king."""
